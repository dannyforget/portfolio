data-description="The goal: To pick a magazine suitable to the article and its subject matter, to then create a cover page, double page spread and full layout consistent with the magazine’s established style. Wired Magazine was a good fit for this article that sheds light on why people take more liberties with poor behaviour online and how that impacts others. As a first editorial it was challenging to take on two roles, that of graphic designer and art director. Lucky for me I stumbled upon a good friend of mine's graphite drawings, which I loved. They inspired the whole process. Gratitude to good friends who graciously lend you their work. Cover & Illustrations by Malcolm Judah.">

data-description="This project involved designing a unique pop can with rendering, learning essential Adobe Illustrator tools and skills in the process. The rendering was a challenge, getting the angles and curves just right wasn't easy on a first pass, or a second one. The space theme was inspired by animation. As a voice over artist I've played all sorts of animals and strange creatures. I saw this can as a prop on a kids tv show or for a character in a Pixar film, always in the hands of that odd little creature who's never without his Bang Bang Pop. He just loves it. What an addict.

data-description="This was a research heavy project that involved an extensive proposal complete with objective, rationale, and 10-15 sketch options for a company logo. The sketches were then narrowed down to 3 for colour and greyscale.The challenge here was creating 
icons for someone that had a very personal take on things and wanted a clear hand 
in the process. It was easy once a good line of communication was established.">

data-description="Designing an interesting cracker box complete with dielines and a press ready file was the goal here. The folds and dielines had to be exact in measurement, and the glue marks, strategically placed. Finicky work but Illustrator's measurement tools helped make the precision possible. But the hardest part of it all, was in casting the ad. Luckily we came across a super talented actor willing to eat a cracker sandwich.

data-description="The Goal: Choose a company and create 3 Ads for print and social media. 
The Challenge: Keeping things consistent regardless of medium. Consistency 
was very much dependant on the images, finding those flexible elements that 
could work well anywhere. Once found, it was a question of tailoring. I chose a 
UK Donor Organization which allowed for a slightly darker take on things.
I had just revisited Monty Python and the Ministry of Silly Walks which inspired 
the undercurrent for this campaign. ">

The end result is an interactive glimpse into the screen process of auditioning. With Adobe XD I was able to upload short clips of film, tv and commercial auditions. The challenge was making the clips short enough to be supported by XD. Editing skills came in handy.">

        <h2>I’m Danny,</h2>
        <p>a creative with a playful and personal approach to design. I have a versatile skill set paired with years of work as an actor, writer, and storyteller, all of which lends itself well to the process of creating dynamic and engaging brands. I love diving headfirst into the research and finding all the right elements. And like any good story, it’s all about the little details. A maximalist in style, I use vibrant colours to create bold statements that leave a lasting impression. </p>
